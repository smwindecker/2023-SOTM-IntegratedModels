# 2023 Species on the Move - Integrated Models
Pre-conference workshop

Saras Windecker & David Uribe

To make the most accurate prediction of a species’ distribution it is important to make use of all relevant data. Although opportunistically collected species records are more readily abundant, they also contain lower quality information and are more likely to be biased. Standardised surveys may suffer less observation bias, but they are expensive to conduct and are therefore more likely to have limited spatial extent. Combining opportunistic and standardised data not only gives more information to a model, but also provides a chance for structured survey data to help correct biases in opportunistic data. Model-based data integration allows us to explicitly model the ecological (species’ occupancy/abundance) and observational processes (detection/sampling effort) simultaneously, propagating information contained in each while accounting for appropriate biases. In this skills showcase we will explain the concepts behind model-based data integration, demonstrate its implementation in a Bayesian framework for modeling species’ distributions, and practice with a number of exercises. Our examples will use broad spatial-scale presence-only data and spatial abundance data from structured surveys, and will illustrate how Point process models can be used to facilitate this integration.
